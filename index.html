                <p>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the
                    blind texts.
                    Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A
                    small river named
                    Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country,
                    in which
                    roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the

                    is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum
                    decided to
                    leave
                    for the far World of Grammar.</p>
                <p>The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild
                    Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen.
                    She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When she
                    reached the first
                    hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove,
                    the headline of
                    Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over
                    her cheek, then
                    she continued her way. On her way she met a copy. The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it
                    came from it
                    would have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin would be the
                    word "and" and
                    the
                    Little Blind Text should turn around and return to its own, safe country.</p>
                <p>But nothing the copy said could convince her
                    and so it didn’t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe
                    and Parole and
                    dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she
                    hasn’t been
                    rewritten, then they are still using her.Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries

<!-- Development Strategy

For this project, you will be writing most of your code in js/app.js. Note that it's very important that you plan your project before you start writing any code!
Break your project down into small pieces of work and strategize your approach to each one. With these bite-sized amounts, it'll be easier to debug and fix any issues that appear.

Feel free to implement your own design workflow, but if you get stuck -- here is a walkthrough to get you up and running!

    Start by linking your app.js. where should this file go based on your present knowledge? We’ll test some other locations later.
    Build out your HTML and at least 3 content sections. The rest of your functionality relies on these sections.
        Take a quick look at all the HTML elements in index.html. Note the values for their id, class, and data attributes.
        To manipulate the DOM, you'll be using many of the tools and methods you've learned on these elements (and on those that you will create).
        Which data structure can you use to store these sections? This data structure can represent all sections for your page, so it might be a good idea to save it to a variable.
        How you would iterate (i.e., loop) over this data structure?
        Think about how you can create, say, an unordered list (i.e., bulleted list) in HTML from this structure, and where you be placing that list.
        Think about how you’ll test whether a section is in the viewport.
        What actions are you performing that will cause interactivity with the DOM?
    Build the navigation menu. This will dynamically create a navigation menu based on the sections of the page. This can be a particularly useful trick when you begin
    working with content management systems or APIs when you are uncertain of where the items will be.
        Are you listening for an event for the navigation to build?
        Where are you placing the navigation?
        Where is the text for each navigation item coming from and where are you anchoring to?
        How are you going to add each navigation item to your menu? (Hint: there are several ways to do this. Do some research to figure out which makes the most sense for your situation. Performance? Clarity?).
    Add functionality to distinguish the section in view. While navigating through the page, the section that is active in the viewport/closest to the top should be
    distinguished from the other sections.
        Are you listening for an event for sections to become active?
        How are you going to test which section should be highlighted?
        How can we use classList methods to change the CSS being displayed? What about removing that CSS?
        Check the HTML and CSS files to ensure that what you chose is updated in the other locations.
    Add the functionality to scroll to sections. Clicking on a navigation item should scroll to the appropriate section of the page.
        Which event are you listening for (hint: you were just reading it)?
        There is a default event occurring that we need to stop. How?
        If you don’t recall how HTML page anchors work, read more to figure out which variables you should set.
        There are several javascript methods for scrolling. Which seems like it may be the most simple?
    REFACTOR. At this point, your code should be working properly. Ideally, refactoring happens while you are developing, but as a new developer,
    you often don’t have the whole picture in your head to be able to do so properly.
        Have you run your code through a linter? We request you still follow Udacity standards when the code is complete, but running it through an eslinter is going to help you
        get started in refactoring.
        Are you using ES6 const and let?
        Are all your functions using ES6 arrow functions?
        Is your code DRY? Are there any pieces that would be better served as a helper function to avoid duplication?
        How is your code structured? Have you created functions for the main functionality with properly scoped variables?
        Starting out it’s likely that you will have a globally scoped variables on occasion until you learn more about closures and design patterns.
        But placing your code into functions is a great way to make your code more readable and a way to avoid globally scoped variables.
        Are you using the best method for your iterations?
    Add additional sections to your HTML document. See how the navigation builds.
    Test the performance. The performance of your page can be affected by how you write your javascript as well as where you load your javascript.
        Test loading the javascript in the head vs at the end of the body. What issues arise? Is there a way to still load in the head without breaking the page?
        What is the performance like compared to loading at the end of the body?
    Suggested:
        Add an active state to your navigation items when a section is in the viewport.
        Hide fixed navigation bar while not scrolling (it should still be present on page load).
            Hint: setTimeout can be used to check when the user is no longer scrolling.
        Add a scroll to top button on the page that’s only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page.
        Update/change the design/content.
        Make sections collapsible.

Version Control

Although not a requirement, we recommend using Git from the very beginning. Make sure to commit often and to use well-formatted commit messages that conform to our Git Style Guide.
