                <p>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the
                    blind texts.
                    Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A
                    small river named
                    Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country,
                    in which
                    roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the
                    blind texts it
                    is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum
                    decided to
                    leave
                    for the far World of Grammar.</p>
                <p>The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild
                    Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen.
                    She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When she
                    reached the first
                    hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove,
                    the headline of
                    Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over
                    her cheek, then
                    she continued her way. On her way she met a copy. The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it
                    came from it
                    would have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin would be the
                    word "and" and
                    the
                    Little Blind Text should turn around and return to its own, safe country.</p>
                <p>But nothing the copy said could convince her
                    and so it didn’t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe
                    and Parole and
                    dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she
                    hasn’t been
                    rewritten, then they are still using her.Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries
                    Vokalia and
                    Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the
